Objective:
Generate a graph representation based on CSV data, representing nodes and relationships.

Instructions:
1.Each row in the CSV corresponds to multiple nodes, separated by columns.
2.Each column signifies a node.
3.For relationships:
  -The first column serves as the source node.
  -The second column is the target node.
  -The header of the second column defines the relationship label.
4.Follow this pattern for subsequent columns:
  -The previous column is the source node.
  -The current column is the target node.
  -The header of the current column is the relationship label.
5.Continue this pattern for additional columns, if present.
6.Rows are separated by the newline symbol (\n).
7.If a node with the same name exists, reuse it instead of creating a new one.

Use the CSV data example below to update the graph state:

CSV Data Example 1:
unitCode,courseCode;CITS4009,62510;CITS4009,62530;

Current State:
{}

Updated State:
{ "nodes": [
  { "id": 1, "label": "CITS4009", "color": "#ffffff" },
  { "id": 2, "label": "62510", "color": "#00ff00" }
],
"edges": [
  { "from": 1, "to": 2, "label": "courseCode" }
]
},
{ "nodes": [
  { "id": 1, "label": "CITS4009", "color": "#ffffff" },
  { "id": 3, "label": "62530", "color": "#00ff00" }
],
"edges": [
  { "from": 1, "to": 3, "label": "courseCode" }
]
}
