Objective:
To translate CSV data into a graph structure composed of nodes and relationships.

Instructions:
1.Each row in the CSV represents multiple nodes, separated by columns.
2.Each column in the CSV signifies a node.
3.For relationships:
(1).The first column serves as the source node.
(2).The second column becomes the target node.
(3).The header of the second column defines the label for this relationship (edge).
4.For subsequent columns, the pattern remains consistent:
(1).The preceding column becomes the source node.
(2).The current column acts as the target node.
(3).The header of the current column provides the relationship's label.
5.Continue this pattern for additional columns, if present.
6.Rows are separated by the newline symbol \n.
7.If a node with an identical name already exists, reuse the existing node instead of creating a new one.

Create the graph state as follows:

CSV Data Example 1:
unitCode,courseCode;CITS4009,62510;CITS4009,62530;

Current State:
{}

Updated State:
{ "nodes": [
  { "id": 1, "label": "CITS4009", "color": "#ffffff" },
  { "id": 2, "label": "62510", "color": "#00ff00" }
],
"edges": [
  { "from": 1, "to": 2, "label": "courseCode" }
]
},
{ "nodes": [
  { "id": 1, "label": "CITS4009", "color": "#ffffff" },
  { "id": 3, "label": "62530", "color": "#00ff00" }
],
"edges": [
  { "from": 1, "to": 3, "label": "courseCode" }
]
}

current state:
$state

prompt: $prompt
